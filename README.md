# Lubuntu Learning Log

A technical record of system configuration, kernel exploration, and development environment setup on Lubuntu 24.04 LTS, from my perspective as a first-time linux user.

## Project Purpose
This repository serves as a centralized documentation hub for my transition to a Linux-based development workflow. The primary focus is on maintaining a lightweight, minimal-footprint environment for C programming, kernel study, and system administration.

## System Configuration Summary
Detailed hardware and partitioning rationale can be found in `initial-install.md`.

* **Operating System:** Lubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat)
* **Architecture:** amd64
* **Desktop Environment:** LXQt (chosen for minimal RAM overhead)
* **Memory Profile:** 16GB Physical / 4GB Swap
* **Boot Environment:** UEFI / GRUB (Dual-boot with Windows 11)

## Current Technical Focus
1.  **System Automation:** Developing shell scripts to streamline package management and environment reproducibility.
2.  **Toolchain Setup:** Configuring a robust development stack including GCC, Python3, and Neovim.
3.  **Kernel Studies:** Understanding Linux fundamentals, process management, and the filesystem hierarchy.

## Repository Directory
* `initial-install.md`: Documented strategy for partition layout and OS selection.
* `scripts/`: (Planned) Automation scripts for system maintenance.
* `configs/`: (Planned) Configuration files for Neovim and shell environments.

## Maintenance and Updates
This log is updated as new configurations are implemented or technical milestones are reached. Updates are managed through a standard branching and pull-request workflow to maintain a clean version history.
